## Git and GitHub Basics:
Git diff :

The git diff is an informative command that shows the differences between two commits. It is used to compare the changes made in one commit with the changes made in another commit. Git consider the changed versions of same file as two different files. Then it gives names to these two files and shows the differences between them.

How to read the diff
a -> file A and b -> file B
---- indicates the file A
+++ indicates the file B
@@ indicates the line number

Here the file A and file B are the same file but different versions.
Git will show you the changes made in the file A and file B. It will also show you the line number where the change occurred along with little preview of the change.
Comparing Working Directory and Staging Area

Terminal window
git diff

This command shows the unstaged changes in your working directory compared to the staging area. This command alone will not show you the changes made in the file A and file B, you need to provide options to show the changes.

Comparing Staging Area with Repository
Terminal window
git diff ‚Äìstaged

This command shows the changes between your last commit and the staging area (i.e., changes that are staged and ready to be committed).

Comparing between branches
Terminal window
git diff <branch-name-one> <branch-name-two>

This command compares the difference between two branches. For example:
Another way to compare the difference between two branches is to use the following command:

Terminal window
git diff branch-name-one..branch-name-two

Comparing Specific Commits:
Terminal window
git diff <commit-hash-one> <commit-hash-two>

This command compares the difference between two commits.

Git Stash :

Stash is a way to save your changes in a temporary location. It is useful when you want to make changes to a file but don‚Äôt want to commit them yet. You can then come back to the file later and apply the changes.
Conflicting changes will not allow you to switch branches without committing the changes. Another alternative is to use the git stash command to save your changes in a temporary location.

Terminal window
git stash

This command saves your changes in a temporary location. It is like a stack of changes that you can access later.

Applying and dropping the stash
You can apply and drop the stash by using the following command:
Terminal window
git stash pop
This command applies the stash and drops it from the stash list.

Drop the stash
You can drop the stash by using the following command:
Terminal window
git stash drop

Applying stash to a specific branch
You can apply the stash to a specific branch by using the following command:
Terminal window
git stash apply stash@{0} <branch-name>

Clearing the stash
You can clear the stash by using the following command:
Terminal window
git stash clear

Git Tags :

Tags are a way to mark a specific point in your repository. They are useful when you want to remember a specific version of your code or when you want to refer to a specific commit. Tags are like sticky notes that you can attach to your commits.
Creating a tag

You can create a tag using the following command:
Terminal window
git tag <tag-name>

This command creates a new tag with the specified name. The tag will be attached to the current commit.

Create an annotated tag
You can create an annotated tag using the following command:
Terminal window
git tag -a <tag-name> -m "Release 1.0"

This command creates an annotated tag with the specified name and message. The tag will be attached to the current commit.

Rebase in git :

Git rebase is a powerful Git feature used to change the base of a branch. It effectively allows you to move a branch to a new starting point, usually a different commit, by ‚Äúreplaying‚Äù the commits from the original base onto the new base. This can be useful for keeping a cleaner, linear project history.
Some people like to use rebase over the merge command because it allows you to keep the commit history cleaner and easier to understand. It also allows you to make changes to the code without affecting the original branch.

Merge commits :
 

A merge commit is a commit that combines two or more commits into one. It is created when you merge two or more branches into a single branch. The merge commit contains all the changes from the original branches, and it is used to keep the project history clean and easy to understand.

Rebase:

Rebase is a powerful tool in Git that allows you to move a branch to a new starting point. It effectively replays the commits from the original base onto the new base. This can be useful for keeping a cleaner, linear project history.
Here‚Äôs a flow example of using git rebase with all the commands involved:
Suppose you have a feature branch called feature-branch that you want to rebase onto the main branch.

 

Ensure you are on the branch you want to rebase:

Terminal window
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
This will replay the commits from feature-branch on top of the latest changes in main.
