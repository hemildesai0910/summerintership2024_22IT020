## 📝 Detailed Work Report:
## 📅Day 1: 27/05/2024 (Monday)
## 🔍 Advanced Concepts
    - Advanced database concepts involve understanding more complex and sophisticated ways of handling data and optimizing database performance. This includes mastering techniques like indexing, normalization, denormalization, and understanding transaction control and concurrency.

## 📊 Using Indexes
- Indexes: 
    - These are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They work by creating a separate, smaller data structure that points to the data in the main table.
- Benefits:
    - Speed: Faster query performance.
    - Efficiency: Reduces the need for full table scans.
    - Maintenance: Regularly updating indexes to ensure optimal performance.
## 🏗️ Creating An Index
- Process:
    - Using Workbench UI: Manage indexes through graphical tools.
    - Using SQL Code: Create indexes with SQL statements like CREATE INDEX.
    - Primary Key and Foreign Key: Automatically indexed in MySQL.
## 🔒 Unique Constraint
- Definition: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- Benefits:
    - Data Integrity: Prevents duplicate entries.
    - Implementation: Can be added via Workbench UI or SQL code (UNIQUE constraint).
## ❌ Non-Null Constraint
- Definition: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
- Benefits:
    - Data Integrity: Ensures critical fields are always populated.
    - Implementation: Added via Workbench UI or SQL code (NOT NULL constraint).
  
## 📅Day 2: 28/05/2024 (Tuesday)
## 🛠️ The “BIG 6” Elements of a SQL SELECT Statement
    -1. SELECT: Specifies which columns to retrieve.
    -2. FROM: Indicates the tables to retrieve data from.
    -3. WHERE: Filters records based on specific conditions.
    -4. GROUP BY: Aggregates data by specified columns.
    -5. HAVING: Filters groups based on conditions.
    -6. ORDER BY: Sorts the result set.
## 🔗 Common Join Types
- Inner Join: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
- Left (Outer) Join: Retrieves all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
- Right (Outer) Join: Retrieves all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
- Full (Outer) Join: Retrieves all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
## 📋 Review of CREATE, INSERT, & DELETE
- CREATE SCHEMA: Sets up a new database schema.
- INSERT INTO: Adds new records to a table.
- CREATE TABLE: Defines a new table and its structure within a schema.
- DELETE FROM: Removes records from a table based on specified conditions.
## 🔗 Table Relationships & Cardinality
- Cardinality: Describes the uniqueness of data values in a column.
    - Primary Key: Unique, non-repeating values.
    - Foreign Key: Can repeat, linking one table to another.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/945f7348-46ab-4c78-b17b-ec9a7cb94c46)

- Relationships:
    - One-to-One: Single record in one table relates to a single record in another.
    - One-to-Many: Single record in one table relates to multiple records in another.
    - Many-to-Many: Multiple records in one table relate to multiple records in another.
      
## 📅Day 3: 29/05/2024 (Wednesday)
## 📦 Introduction to Replication

##📝 Row-Based Binary Log File Replication
- Row-Based Replication: Records changes made to individual rows.
    - Advantages: Faster, more efficient.
    - Challenges: Harder to audit as it lacks SQL statements.
## 📜 Statement-Based Binary Log File Replication
- Statement-Based Replication: Records the SQL statements that made changes.
    - Advantages: Easier to read and audit.
    - Challenges: Issues with non-deterministic queries.
## 🔄 Row-Based vs Statement-Based Replication
- Row-Based: Efficient but complex to audit.
- Statement-Based: Easy to audit but can have performance issues with certain queries.

## 🛡️ Introduction to Backup & Recovery
- Purpose: Ensures data is recoverable in case of failure.
- Types of Backups:
    - Physical: Copies raw data files.
    - Logical: Copies SQL statements needed to recreate the database.
    - Online: Taken while the database is running.
    - Offline: Taken when the database is stopped.
    - Local: Stored on the same server.
    - Remote: Stored on a different server or location.

    - Automates complex business rules.
## 🔍 Triggers Deep Dive
- Row-Level Triggers: Operate on individual rows.
- Creating Triggers: Use CREATE TRIGGER statement.
- Modifying Triggers: Drop and recreate using DROP TRIGGER and CREATE TRIGGER.
- Multiple Triggers: Can be set on the same table, executed in defined order.
- Actions: BEFORE or AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
