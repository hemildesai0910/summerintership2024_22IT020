## Git and GitHub Basics:
- Git diff
    - The git diff command shows the differences between two commits. It compares the changes made in one commit with those in another.

- How to Read the Diff:

    - a -> file A
    - b -> file B
    - ---- indicates file A
    - +++ indicates file B
    - @@ indicates the line number
- Command Examples:

    - Compare Working Directory and Staging Area: git diff
    - Compare Staging Area with Repository: git diff --staged
    - Compare Branches: git diff <branch-one> <branch-two>
    - Compare Specific Commits: git diff <commit-one> <commit-two>
- Git Stash
- Stash temporarily saves your changes.

- Commands:
    - Save changes: git stash
    - Apply and drop: git stash pop
    - Drop: git stash drop
    - Apply to a specific branch: git stash apply stash@{0} <branch-name>
    - Clear stash: git stash clear

- Git Tags
- Tags mark specific points in your repository.

- Commands:
    - Create tag: git tag <tag-name>
    - Create annotated tag: git tag -a <tag-name> -m "Release 1.0"
- Rebase in Git
    - Rebase moves a branch to a new starting point, replaying the commits.
